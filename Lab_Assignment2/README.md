Assignment 2 focuses on the implementation of Non-linear Least Square Estimation (LSE) using Python, applied to a real-world problem related to Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) measurements. The task simulates a scenario in which we develop an algorithm for Single Point Positioning (SPP).
In this assignment, we applied our understanding of LSE, data manipulation, and visualization using libraries like Pandas and Matplotlib. We also worked with satellite data, and used Python's numerical libraries for solving non-linear estimation problems.
