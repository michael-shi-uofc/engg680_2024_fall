Assignment 4 focuses on ysing supervised machine learning to classify vehicle motion states using sensor data. Support Vector Machines (SVC) are trained with hyperparameter tuning via GridSearchCV. The assignment also explores feature selection, dimensionality reduction with PCA, and comparisons of model performance across tasks. An alternative classification algorithm is implemented to evaluate its performance against the SVC models.
