Assignment 3 focuses on the implementation of Non-linear Gradient Descent using Python, applied to a real-world problem related to Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) measurements. We also applied our understanding of Logistic Regression, where we downloaded a phishing dataset online, and we implemented a machine learning model (Logistic Regression) and visualized our results. We also answered questions regarding our results and provided analysis.
