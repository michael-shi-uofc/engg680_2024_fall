Assignment 3 explores the application of Non-linear Gradient Descent in Python, addressing a Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) positioning problem through iterative optimization. Additionally, the assignment includes a machine learning component where Logistic Regression is applied to a phishing dataset. We implemented the model, visualized the results, and provided a detailed analysis of the results.
